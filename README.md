Hi! I'm Sm√°ri. I'm a human from Earth. I write code, and sometimes other types of text. I work at [Ecosophy](https://ecosophy.is) doing climate stuff. I rant [here](https://smarimccarthy.is).

I work mostly in Jai, Python, and C. Reluctantly also Typescript, Fortran and some others.

## Jai libraries

A lot of my recent open source work has been in the form of developing various libraries for use with the Jai programming language. More details in the [Jai Community Wiki](https://github.com/Jai-Community/Jai-Community-Library/wiki/References#community-libraries)

 * [Cryptography primitives](https://github.com/smari/jai-crypto) - disasterously incomplete, but working SHA-2 functions.
 * [GDAL bindings](https://github.com/smari/jai-gdal)
 * [GraphBLAS bindings](https://github.com/smari/jai-graphblas)
 * [INI library](https://github.com/smari/jai-ini)
 * [libMagic bindings](https://github.com/smari/jai-magic)
 * [NanoID](https://github.com/cguess/nanoid-jai) implementation (with [Chris Guess](https://github.com/cguess))
 * [Redis bindings](https://github.com/smari/jai-redis)
 * [S3 bindings](https://github.com/smari/jai-s3)
 * [SimpleHTTP](https://github.com/smari/jai-simplehttp) - a simple HTTP server.
