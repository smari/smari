Hi! I'm Sm√°ri. I'm a human from Earth. I write code, and sometimes other types of text. I work at [Ecosophy](https://ecosophy.is) doing climate stuff. I rant [here](https://smarimccarthy.is).

I work mostly in Jai, Python, and C. Reluctantly also Typescript, Fortran and some others.

## Jai libraries

A lot of my recent open source work has been in the form of developing various libraries for use with the Jai programming language. More details in the [Jai Community Wiki](https://github.com/Jai-Community/Jai-Community-Library/wiki/References#community-libraries)

 * [https://github.com/smari/jai-graphblas](GraphBLAS bindings)
 * [https://github.com/smari/jai-ini](INI library)
 * [https://github.com/smari/jai-magic](libMagic bindings)
 * [https://github.com/cguess/nanoid-jai](NanoID) implemntation (with [https://github.com/cguess](Chris Guess))
